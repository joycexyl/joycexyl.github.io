# Creative/Artistic Design Guidelines

## Design Philosophy
Create a bold, unique, and visually striking personal website that breaks from traditional conventions while maintaining usability and accessibility.

## Visual Principles

### 1. Bold Typography
- Use large, expressive headings (48px-96px for hero text)
- Mix serif and sans-serif fonts for contrast
- Experiment with font weights (from 100 to 900)
- Consider variable fonts for dynamic effects
- Limit to 2-3 font families maximum

### 2. Unique Color Schemes
- Use bold, unexpected color combinations
- Consider gradients and color transitions
- Implement color overlays on sections
- Use contrasting colors for emphasis (ensure WCAG compliance)
- Consider dark backgrounds with vibrant accents

### 3. Asymmetric Layouts
- Avoid traditional centered, symmetrical designs
- Use diagonal lines and angles
- Overlap elements intentionally
- Create visual tension with off-center placements
- Use negative space strategically

### 4. Artistic Elements
- Abstract geometric shapes as background elements
- SVG illustrations or custom graphics
- Animated elements (subtle, purposeful)
- Creative section dividers
- Unique hover effects and interactions

### 5. Motion & Animation
- Smooth scroll effects
- Entrance animations for sections
- Parallax scrolling (when appropriate)
- Hover state transitions
- Keep animations under 500ms for performance

## Layout Structure

### Homepage Sections
1. **Hero Section**
   - Full viewport height or more
   - Bold statement or introduction
   - Eye-catching visual element
   - Unconventional navigation placement

2. **About Me Section**
   - Personal narrative
   - Image/photo (artistic treatment)
   - Personality showcase
   - Unique presentation (not traditional bio format)

3. **Footer** (expandable)
   - Social links
   - Contact information
   - Subtle branding

## Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px+
- Simplify artistic elements on mobile (performance)
- Maintain creative spirit across all screen sizes

## Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- Color contrast ratio 4.5:1 for text
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- Reduced motion preferences respected

## Performance Guidelines
- Optimize images (WebP format where possible)
- Lazy load non-critical elements
- Minimize animation complexity
- Keep total page size under 1MB
- Target Lighthouse score 90+

## Design Don'ts
- Avoid stock photo backgrounds
- Don't use generic templates
- Avoid excessive parallax (causes motion sickness)
- Don't sacrifice readability for aesthetics
- Avoid auto-playing media with sound
